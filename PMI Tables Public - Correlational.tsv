Low pH is associated with necrosis of the granule layer. 	"The distribution of LNAse activity was the same in all normal cerebella (49 cases)" ... "Regardless of the cause of death LNAse activity was found in all cases throughout the granular layer without any demonstrable variation in the loss of activity in the central and peripheral parts. No cases were found without enzyme activity." ... "[T]he LNAse activity was preserved with unchanged activity even many hours after death.

Albrechtsen 1977b	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/848288/	Human	Light microscopy	Morphological staining, for example with H&E	6 to 83 or more hours (83 hours is the highest PMI listed, but the full range not reported)	83 hours	1000	Cerebellum	Not recorded	Presence and severity of necrosis of granule cell layer of the cerebellum	Seems to be a tendency for an increase in degree of granule cell necrosis with increasing PMI, but it is not statistically significant. Note that necrosis is mostly graded based on properties of the cell nuclei. 	"Table 4 shows the incidence of necrosis according to severity, related to the interval between death and autopsy. There would seem to be a tendency for increased number of necroses with ioncreasing interval, but the difference is not statistically significant."	Yes

"On electron microscopic examination, unfrozen white matter obtained at autopsy (8 h post-mortem) showed lamellar separation similar to that described in cerebral edema (14). This observation of post-mortem lamellar separation secondary to edema is consistent with the reported increase in water content of the brain (approximately 10%) that occurs during the time interval between death and autopsy (3). This unfrozen autopsy material, however, showed no break in the continuity of the separated myelin lamellae."	Yes

However, no loss of structural integrity under light microscopy at the longer PMIs. 	"In both cortical and brainstem preparations, postmortem intervals longer than 8 h resulted in less extensive labelling." ...

"The postmortem interval was similar for the control and schizophrenic groups, as were the fixation interval and the hypoxia index. The age of the schizophrenic subjects (48.5 ± 23.0 years), however, was lower than that for the control cases. Simple linear regression analyses indicated that there was not a significant relationship between any of the confounding variables and either small- or large-caliber glutamate-immunoreactive fibers (Table 2), suggesting that these factors, particularly age, do not account for the differences in fiber density observed in the schizophrenic group"	No

Subgroup correlations were found (PMI is positively associated with non-pyramidal neuron density in the bipolar group and negatively associated with glial density in layer II in the control group); however, there was no adjustment for multiple comparisons. 	"When the three groups were combined, correlation analyses revealed that there were no significant relationships of age or PMI with the density of PNs, NPs, or glial cells in any of the layers. Similarly, when the data were broken down according to diagnostic groups, there were also no significant relationships between these two potential confounds and the density of PNs and NPs in the schizophrenic subjects. For the PMI, the density of glial cells in the control subjects showed a significant negative correlation in layer II (r = −.57; p = .05). For the bipolar group, however, there was a significant positive correlation (r = .80; p = .007) between the density of NPs and PMI."	Yes

"This prompted further examination of the cases to determine whether iAbeta presence was correlated with postmortem interval (PMI), gender, or presence of AD. Variable iAbeta immunoreactivity was noted in both very short and very long PMI subsets (Fig. 3). Two biopsy samples were strongly positive for iAbeta immunoreactivity yet some cases with a PMI of 24 h also had strong iAbeta immunoreactivity. Analysis of PMI for all cases examined showed no correlation between PMI and iAbeta immunoreactivity intensity (p>0.1). Gender was also found to not be a factor in i iAbeta immunoreactivity (p>0.1). Evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, revealed that all samples were well preserved with ideal cellular morphology and showed no evidence of tissue disruption or infection."

"Almost invariably, the Golgi-Cox method impregnated a large number of neurons which were fairly evenly distributed. Dendritic extent varied greatly within each section, from cells with rich, apparently normal dendritic trees to cells with clearly atrophic trees. Examples of each type, as well as of cells which appeared intermediate between the two extremes, were numerous. Tissues prepared by the rapid Golgi method gave a very different picture. Impregnation was often patchy with large areas devoid of impregnated cells. The cells which did impregnate were predominantly those with grossly atrophic trees or aberrant morphology. Our findings do not vary according to age, mental status, or postmortem time of sampling."	No
Chan-Palay 1986	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2422984/	Human	Light microscopy, electron microscopy	Immunostaining for neuropeptide Y	Comparison of surgical biopsy cases (n = 19) to autopsy cases (n = 12) with a PMI of 8.5 to 36 hours	36 hours	31	Cerebral cortex	Multiple conditions	Neuropeptide Y immunostaining	Worse preservation in the autopsy tissue than the surgical biopsy tissue. Axons can usually be traced, but there are more varicosities they are more irregular in size and shape. Dendrites are shorter, thicker, and more contorted. Neuronal cell bodies are reported to be "generally clearly immunoreactive". Despite having this worse reported preservation, they also report that "NPY-immunoreactivity is well preserved in neural structures for considerable periods after death". 	"In the surgical biopsy specimens immunostained with anti-NPY serum, the neurons of the cerebral cortex are displayed in their entirety (Fig. 1~d). The perikarya are completely filled with reaction product, the dendrites are long and slender, and thin varicose axons can be traced from their initial segments for long distances, sometimes even up to 3 mm. The axonal plexuses in the neighboring neuropil have numerous fine varicose axons and the whole forms a network of intricate delicacy." ... "Even the best material obtained from postmortem con- trol brains successfully tested with NPY pales by compari- son with the surgical specimens. Although optimal post- mortem material can be good, and neuronal cell bodies are generally clearly immunoreactive, the dendrites appear somewhat foreshortened and thicker and unusually tor- tuous. The most pronounced difference is in the axonal plexuses. Axons from neurons can usually be followed. The plexuses in the neuropil are also abundant but not as deli- cate in appearance. Perhaps the most distinct difference is that the varicosities or boutons on axonal twigs are larger - 2-4 times the size of those in surgical specimens, are more irregular in size and shape, and often have intervari- cose segments that are difficult to distinguish. Basically, axons are thicker, there are shorter single segments, vari- cosities are thicker, the intervaricose segments are shorter and clusters of axons are coarser. The dendrites are shorter, thicker and more contorted."	Yes

"No major abnormalities in cell morphology or tissue integrity were noted. Immunohistochemistry with GFAP and NF did not show any significant increase in signal in FC at high PMI." ... "Histological examination of the sections from four anatomical areas at different times of post-mortem delay (9 samples) revealed essentially similar features of cytoarchitecture and density of myelin. The immunolabelling character for GFAP and NF (Fig. 8) was essentially similar at 4 and 18 h PMI"	No

"PMI and time in formalin had no detectable effects on our measures of cell size. But whereas PMI had no effect on the number of immunoreactive profiles counted, formalin-fixation time correlated negatively and significantly with profile number. ...

Das 2019	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31152449/	Human	Light microscopy	DiI staining	10 to 28 hours	28 hours	13	Hippocampus	Sudden death 	Neuronal morphology	No correlation between PMI and degradation of neuronal morphology, such as dendritic spines and axon boutons. 	"Figure 2 shows a representative set of neurons and dendritic segments from several brains. Note that despite being from tissue fixed 11–18 hours postmortem, we do not observe blebbing, neurite fragmentation, or other obvious hallmarks of cell death, hypoxia, or ischemia (Figure 2). Though we cannot exclude that any postmortem interval leads to changes in neuron morphology, the neuron morphology in our samples appears well preserved and the secondary dendrites are a consistent caliber with even DiI labeling and diffusion." ... "In contrast, our DiI-based methodological pipeline generates high quality dendritic spine labeling in human tissues with a longer postmortem delay; thus far we tested up to 28 hours postmortem. When labeled, the neurons do not show obvious morphological signs of hypoxia, ischemia, or damage cause neuron such as blebbing, fragmentation, or poor diffusion of DiI (Fig 1e), suggesting good membrane integrity and relatively healthy tissue. Here, we report a mean CA1 apical spine density of 2.21 spines/μm of dendrite with a range from 1.36 to 3.04 spines/μm in adult human brain. These spine densities in neurons labeled from tissue fixed 10–28 hours postmortem is strikingly consistent with previously reported spine densities of control human CA1 neurons in tissue fixed 2–3 hours postmortem (Merino-Serrais et al., 2013) and to the average CA1 spine density found in non-human primates optimally preserved by perfusion."

"On the basis of our observations and other published data, we conclude that human glia, both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, rapidly take up plasma proteins from the extracellular space of the injured brain" ... "[T]he pronounced swelling with eosinophilia is exaggerated by postmortem delay of fixation. Whether this represents an active process that continues in a devitalized environment, or a passive response by cells with abnormally high soluble protein content in the cytoplasm is unknown."	Yes

"There was a significant inverse correlation (p<0.01) between age and spine density in the non-schizophrenic controls but the correlation was not significant for postmortem interval and spine density, whether this was calculated by parametric (Pearson) or non-parametric (Spearman) tests (table 3 and fig 3)."

"Analysis of the potential confounding factors on the test results revealed no significant influence of age, duration of disease or psychotropic medication. Autolysis time was negatively correlated with the numerical density of QUIN-immunoreactive microglia in the right CA1 (controls: rPearson = 0.592, p = 0.043, p = 0.016; schizophrenia: rPearson = 0.661, p = 0.014).

"The overall level of immunopositivity or aII-bdp1 in the adult human brain was sparse, although focally positive cells were identified in every region. There was no correlation of the frequency of aII-bdp1 positive cells with the postmortem interval or with the rare cells noted above that appeared to display perimortem anoxic/ischemic change. A semi-quantitative analysis of neuronal immunopositivity for aII-bdp was conducted by visual survey, with score 1 representing immunopositive neurons up to 25% of the neuronal population and score 4 representing immunopositive neurons of more than 75% of the neuronal population. The highest score was noted in the cerebellum (mean score, 2.33; Table 1). There was no correlation between calpain-cleaved spectrin and the postmortem interval (P ¼ 0:6041, r ¼ 20:232, by Spearman rank correlation). ... In the cerebellum, moderate to strong and occasionally focal immunoreactivity in Purkinje cells was consistently found (Fig. 2A).

However, there is a change in volume fraction, length, surface-to-volume ratio, and number of capillaries per test area in the longer PMI case. 	"In contrast to the experiment the human investigation revealed no in- fluence on the above-mentioned stereological parameters at two postmor- tem times. Although volume fraction, length, surface-to-volume ratio and number per test area of the parietal, temporal and occipital lobe (Tab. 3) yield tendencies similar to those recorded in the experiment, the capillary network of the human cerebral cortex appears to be relatively resistent to postmortem changes. The fact that capillary diameter remains unchanged postmortem provides encouragement to continue further stereological in- vestigations of aging human brain" ... "As in the animal experiment, the capillary diameter of the human cortex is not affected by different postmortem times. The individual diameter values of the parietal lobe (postcentral gyrus) do not differ much from each other (Fig. 3). Except for the frontal region, the stereological behaviour of the human parameters is similar to the significant differences between the measurements intravitam and 22 hours postmortem in the animal experiment (Tab. 2): volume fraction, length per unit cortex volume and number of capillary fragments per measuring field tend to decrease, whereas the surface-to- volume ratio is moderately increased (Tab. 3). The minimal capillary distances vary only weakly in dependence on the two different postmortem times."	Yes

Compared to perfusion fixed experimental tissue, synaptic structures are less clearly demarcated, but this does not appear to be a correlated with PMI in their sample. (Reported difference from expected results based on perfusion fixation versus immersion fixation, but not based on the PMI within the sample.) 	"Samples from 21 brains, at ages ranging from newborn to 90 years, were studied. Synaptic profiles were clearly evident in postmortem cerebral cortical tissue, although their definition was often somewhat less sharp than in perfusion-fixed experimental tissue (Fig. 1A). The presynaptic projections and postsynaptic bands appeared somewhat more diffuse and less sharply demarcated, and the intracleft lines were not always demonstrable. However, these features did not seriously interfere with the ability to enumerate synaptic profiles. Synapse counts appeared to be stable for 35 h postmortem (Fig. 2), no relationship being demonstrable between calculated synaptic densities and the length of time that elapsed before the tissue was fixed in glutaraldehyde"	No

The tissue examined did not exhibit the autolytic changes (e.g., irregular varicose enlargements, constriction of dendrites, incomplete impregnation, and loss of spines) described by Williams et al.

"We have managed to conduct very effective EM studies on tissues retrieved from donors with long post mortem intervals, up to 100 hours. In our experience a key element in tissue preservation for ultrastructure analysis is post mortem cold storage of the cadaver, with cold storage in a mortuary of around 4–6°C significantly reducing structural degradation."

"With lengthening postmortem intervals, loss of MAP2 immunoreactivity progressed in most of the CA1-subiculum neurons" ... "In the brains of a PMI of 11–16 h (cases H1–3), MAP2 immunoreactivity was preserved in the dendrites of a large number of the CA1-subiculum neurons (Figs. 1a and 2a), although cytoplasmic accumulation of MAP2 was more evident in the area adjacent to the stratum oriens than in other areas (Fig. 2a). Intensity and localization of MAP2 staining had altered less in brains with a PMI of 1.5 d (cases H4–5) (Fig. 2b) than in the normothermic group (Fig. 2c and d). In brains with a PMI of 2–3 d (cases H6–8), the CA1 neurons showed decreases in the number of immunopositive dendrites and intense cytoplasmic immunoreactivity, although the changes were less remarkable." ...

Other structures such as Von Economo Neurons, microtubules, neurofilaments, synapses, and vesicles were reported to be well-preserved. No reported worsening of ultrastructure with PMIs greater than 24 hours. 	"In human pathology, the post-mortem interval is a relevant factor for tissue preservation. It is known that degenerative alterations in the cytoplasm of glial cells and within the axoplasm can occur within 24 h at 4 °C, and especially mitochondria are known to be vulnerable to degeneration. The same degenerative effects already appear after 6 h at a storage temperature of 25 °C (Hukkanen and Röyttä, 1987). In our study, the tissue had a mean post-mortem interval of 31.89 ± 9.649 h and showed the typical ultra-structural alterations of network-like splitting of the inner part of the myelin sheath (Fig. 3A), as described by Hukkanen and Röyttä (1987). However, other structures such as microtubules, neurofilaments, synapses, vesicles and mitochondria were well preserved (Fig. 3B–D). In particular, entire neurons such as VENs, which are currently of most interest in investigations of psychiatric disorders, could be depicted clearly in a collage of merged micrographs (Fig. 3E)." ...

"The 16 animals that died from inanition before they could be killed by the perfusion-fixation technic, and whose brains were fixed by immersion in solution of formaldehyde U.S.P. (1:4), showed neuronal changes not unlike many of those that have been described by previous investigators. Sections of the brain prepared by the method for myelin sheaths stained lighter than similar sections from the animals that had been killed by perfusion and lighter than sections from the control animals. Similarly, the sections stained by the technic for Nissl substance appeared lighter. Microscopic examination demonstrated marked generalized changes in all parts of the brain. Some nerve cells were considerably shrunken; others were swollen. The Nissl body patterns were clouded, and in some instances there appeared to be almost complete chromatolysis. Many nerve cells were vacuolated. The perineuronal and perivascular spaces were much larger than those in sections from the control animals. Even in the specimens that were fixed by immersion within one hour after death, such changes were widespread.

"Electron microscopic observations of postmortem human brain are possible when the tissue is obtained shortly after death and immersed immediately in cold fixative containing glutaraldehyde. Several other factors other than the PMI can affect the use of postmortem tissue for electron micros- copy, such as the agonal status of the individual and ambient temperature. The ultrastructural integrity of the tissue was compromised if the PMIs were much longer than 7 hours. As the PMI increased beyond several hours, certain structures deteriorated, rendering quantitative analysis difficult, if not impossible. For example, membra- nous structures were lost or distorted, such as pre- and postsynaptic membranes, synaptic vesicles, and myelin. The postsynaptic density became unnaturally thick, mak- ing it difficult to determine whether the synapses were asymmetric or symmetric. Profiles such as axon terminals, spines, dendrites, and mitochondria became bloated andlor irregular in contour, making assessments of size inaccu- rate. The extracellular spaces enlarged in size, making measurements of synaptic density potentially inaccurate. Extracellular space was very sensitive to PMI and was expanded in some but not all areas, even in tissue with very short PMIs (<7 hours). The tissue used in this study, however, had PMIs less than 4 hours and therefore was not afflicted by these postmortem artifacts, other than an occasional expansion in extracellular space.

"Our postmortem tissue used for electron microscopy was fixed in eight hours or under, so there should be minimal diffusion due to PMI. Also, the effect of PMI on a small mouse brain is likely to be much more dramatic than in the much larger human brain, meaning that the PMI could probably be much longer in humans without deleterious effects. Several studies using postmortem human tissue with PMIs equivalent to or greater than ours show no correlation between PMI and EAAT protein levels and/or show a similar distribution to that of the present study, suggesting that EAAT protein is not degraded in tissues with PMIs <20.

However, this appeared to occur more slowly in human cases than rats. 	"The distribution of tau-I, MAP2, and MAPlB in the surgical specimens was similar to that observed in the immersion-fixed rat brain, with tau-I being predominant in axons, MAP2 in dendrites, and MAP1B immunoreactivity present in both axons and dendrite. A slight perikaryal accu- mulation of MAP2 and MAPlB (Fig. lo), but not of tau-1, was evident. In the hippocampus obtained at autopsy, altera- tions in MAPlB and MAP2 were similar to those observed in the postmortem rat brain. Extensive perikaryal immuno- staining in the dentate gyrus, hilus, CA3, subiculum and occa- sional neuron in CA1 was observed in all autopsy tissues. Somatic tau-l immunoreactivity was observed in all of the autopsy cases, but in three ofthe cases (Al-A3) it was evident only in CA3c, adjacent to CA2 (Fig. 11). In the remaining cases, perikaryal tau accumulation was also evident through- out CAI, as well as in the dentate gyrus, hilus, CA3, and subiculum. This was particularly prominent in case A5, which had the longest postmortem interval." ...

On light microscopy, vacuoles increase with the PMI and there are decreasing structural details in the surrounding matrix with increasing PMI. 	"Figure 3 shows that the PMI appeared to have an influence on the preservation of the myelin sheaths: the shorter the PMI, the higher the percentage of well-preserved parts of the myelin sheaths" ... "Light microscopic signs of autolysis were dilations around the vessels and the glia cells. These increased dramatically in size with increasing PMI (Fig. 5). The samples taken from case 1 (PMI 16 h, frontal grey matter) showed a dense organization of the neuronal tissue with a high number of finer structures. In the samples taken from frontal white matter (Fig. 5c-e), with increasing PMI, the organization of the tissue loosened more and more, and vacuole-like structures (putative degraded cellular compartments that could not be recognized any more) dominated instead (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6).

In line with this, statistical analysis did not reveal any correlation between coll XVII and the studied variables, i.e. age at death, gender, post-mortem delay and fixation time.

However, the immunostaining patterns were qualitatively similar. 	"It is important to note that the general pattern and qualitative aspects of immunoreactivities were equivalent for the operating room and autopsy tissues. As expected, the longer postmortem intervals did result in progressive deterioration of the tissue. This included the appearance of vacuoles and a general decrease in the intensity and number of immunoreactive processes. Analyses of human tissue are limited due to the interval between cessation of respiration and fixation. This is especially problematic for studies using antibodies to antigenic sites that degrade very quickly prior to fixation. In these cases it is crucial to recognize that the absence of immunoreactivity does not necessarily imply the absence of the antigenic site. Consequently, it is appropriate to exercise caution in making comparisons with results obtained from other species in which perfusions were used to prepare the tissue. Nevertheless, the analyses and results described in the present report appear to be qualitatively consistent with prior studies."	Yes
