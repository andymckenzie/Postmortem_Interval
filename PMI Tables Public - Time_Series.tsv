Numerous large and small accumulations of TdT labeling were present in the neuropil. These areas could reflect TdT labeling attributable to cell lysis, caused by either postmortem necrosis or secondary necrosis in apoptotic cells. At this time point, the quality of cellular TdT labeling appeared more homogeneous and agranular or diffuse than that observed earlier, although what we have termed apoptotic-like nuclei based on morphological characteristics were still present.

"Electron microscopic examination of the surgical material that was incubated for 2 h showed lamellar separation along the interperiod line but no accompanying lamellar fragmentation was detected. These findings are similar to those described in unincubated autopsy material (2). In this autopsy material that showed lamellar separation but no lamellar fragmentation, subsequent incubations did not result in any detectable loss of BP. These observations with surgical and autopsy material would lend support to the postulated location of BP along the cytoplasmic surface of myelin lamellae (9). BP located in this area would not be exposed to extracellular acid proteinases by lamellar separation alone. An actual break in the continuity of myelin lamellae would be necessary in order for the proteinases to gain access to BP in this location."	No	NA	1	1	1	NA	1

This phenomenon was also observed in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and throughout the other hippocampal regions. The somas of the large multipolar cells located in the rostral polymorphic layer of the dentate gyrus were much less intensely stained in immersion-fixed tissue (Figure 8C, D), but as there was a high degree of inter-individual variability it was not possible to determine whether there was a correlation between postmortem interval and staining intensity.

These observations were supported by decreased optical density of doublecortin staining in the outer granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus (Fig. 1e).

Despite delays in fixation for up to 6 hours, the dendritic spines of impregnated cortical pyramids are generally of normal density and morphology (Fig. 6). However, spines on the lightly impregnated basal and oblique dendritic branches mentioned above also appear to be impregnated incompletely with thin stalks and barely visible terminal enlargements. With delays beyond 6 hours, on the other hand, some spines appear abnormally thick with irregular expansions along their stalks. In some cases this appearance appears to be due to the coalescence of 2 or more filamentous spines." ... + Figure 6	No	NA	2	1	1	NA	1
